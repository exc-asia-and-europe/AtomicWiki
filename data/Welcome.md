If you just installed the wiki from the eXist-db repository, you should be able to log in as user "editor" with password "editor". This is the default wiki admin user. 

Please refer to the [Getting Started](help/GettingStarted) document for an overview.

    ## Atom-based
    
    __AtomicWiki__ is a simple, but powerful wiki/blog software using the [Atom 
    Syndication Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29) as its
    underlying storage format. The wiki space is 
    organized into a hierarchy of feeds containing one or more entries. A 
    feed can either display all entries in chronological order (blog style) or
    show each entry as a single page (wiki style).

    ## HTML5 and Markdown
    
    Choose between an HTML5 editor or [Markdown syntax](/help/Markdown) for editing texts. Thanks to the WYSWYG editor, writing HTML does not require any technical knowledge. Markdown allows authors to quickly compose texts once they learned the simple syntax.
    
    AtomicWiki supports the *github extensions* to markdown, including: *syntax
    highlighted source code* and *tables*.

    ## Powered by XML and XQuery
    
    The wiki is entirely written in XQuery and backed by the eXistdb XML database. AtomicWiki ships as a single application archive and integrates well with other apps running in the same database context.

    ## Themes
    
    Every feed may have its own theme. Just overwrite any HTML template or 
    stylesheet from the main theme and adopt it.

    ## Access Control
    
    Restrict access to specific feeds or entries to a group of collaborators or keep your text entirely private until you publish it.

    ## Image Galleries
    
    Being used by art historians, the wiki provides a separate editor for image
    galleries (slideshows).

            <h2>Atom-based</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>AtomicWiki</strong> is a simple, but powerful wiki/blog software using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom Syndication Format</a> as its underlying storage format. The wiki space is organized into a hierarchy of feeds containing one or more entries. A feed can either display all entries in chronological order (blog style) or show each entry as a single page (wiki style).</p>

            <h2>HTML5 and Markdown</h2>
            <p>Choose between an HTML5 editor or <a href="/help/Markdown">Markdown syntax</a> for editing texts. Thanks to the WYSWYG editor, writing HTML does not require any technical knowledge. Markdown allows authors to quickly compose texts once they learned the simple syntax.</p>
            <p>AtomicWiki supports the <em>github extensions</em> to markdown, including: <em>syntax highlighted source code</em> and <em>tables</em>.</p>

            <h2>Powered by XML and XQuery</h2>
            <p>The wiki is entirely written in XQuery and backed by the eXistdb XML database. AtomicWiki ships as a single application archive and integrates well with other apps running in the same database context.</p>
